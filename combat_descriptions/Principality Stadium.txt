You end up on the pristine pitch of the Principality Stadium, the massive stands towering empty around you. A group of burly rugby players emerges from the tunnel, their expressions suggesting this isn't a friendly encounter. The floodlights cast long shadows as the players spread out in a familiar defensive formation, blocking your path to the nearest exit. You quickly scan your surroundings and see near the try line, a match-worn rugby ball sits abandoned on a kicking tee. You also see, by the touchline, a kit bag has spilled open, revealing several pairs of studded boots.
