You enter into the dimly lit Evolution of Wales gallery at the National Museum of Wales, surrounded by prehistoric displays. A team of security guards has cornered you near the dinosaur exhibit, their walkie-talkies crackling with static. You try and run out of the main exit of the museum but the guards have prevented your only chance of escape by slamming the exits shut. Their flashlight beams cut through the darkness, reflecting off the glass cases. You notice several small fossil specimens within reach on a nearby display table, labeled for an upcoming exhibition.
