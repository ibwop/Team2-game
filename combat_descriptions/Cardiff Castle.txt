Through the narrow arrowslits in the wall, you notice a crowd of angry knights storming towards you. You turn and run, but the grand metal gate slowly draws shut, trapping you in. On the far side of the castle you notice an opening in the wall - your only way out...\n\nAbove the entrance, two long iron swords are mounted in a cross. A crossbow rests to your right, alongside a quill of arrows. Up the twisting stone stairs, you glimspe a large wooden catapult, and a pile of rocks.
